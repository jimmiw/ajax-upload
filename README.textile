This is a small "Ajax-upload" component, written in javascript.
It's goal is to mimic the behavior of the google gmail attach file component. 

So far, the component can be initialized on a form tag, (using the form's id). It will then hide the current form and add it's own.
The newly added form's file field, will have an "onchange" event, that automatically submits the chosen file, to the forms action.
A nice progressbar should then be displayed and a new file field should be added (with it's own form and iframe), ready to upload more data to the site.


TODO:
* Send the data to the actual action.
* Hide the current file field.
* Show a nice progress bar when uploading.
* Create a new file field ready for uploading.
* Remove the uploading field, when the upload is done.
** Display a small message saying: "Upload done", then hide the field (2 secs delay?)
