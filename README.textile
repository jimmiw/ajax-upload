This is a small "Ajax-upload" component, written in javascript.
It's goal is to mimic the behavior of the google gmail attach file component. 

So far, the component can be initialized on a form tag, (using the form's id). It will then hide the current form and add it's own.
The newly added form's file field, will have an "onchange" event, that automatically submits the chosen file, to the forms action.

After you have chosen a file to upload, a nice "Uploading File..." text appears and a new file field is added (with it's own form and iframe), ready to upload more data to the backend.

h2. How to
It's really easy to get started. All you need to do, is have a normal form, with the enctype set and have a file field inside it. Add the correct action and method (POST) and you are ready to start.

h3. Example
I've added a simple example to get you started.

h2. Options
You can use the following options to pass to the object, when initializing it:

|_. Option name |_. Description |
| formId | The id of the form to do the magic on. *REQUIRED* |

| uploadingText | Pass this to set a different text when uploading. |
| uploadDoneText | Pass this to set a different upload done text. |

h2. TODO
List of things that could be fun to have / add.

* Show a nice progress bar when uploading.
